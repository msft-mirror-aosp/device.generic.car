    <!-- Whether to only install system packages on a user if they're allow-listed for that user
         type. These are flags and can be freely combined.
         0  - disable allow-list (install all system packages; no logging)
         1  - enforce (only install system packages if they are allow-listed)
         2  - log (log non-allow-listed packages)
         4  - any package not mentioned in the allow-list file is implicitly allow-listed on all users
         8  - same as 4, but just for the SYSTEM user
         16 - ignore OTAs (don't install system packages during OTAs)
         Common scenarios:
          - to enable feature (fully enforced) for a complete allow-list: 1
          - to enable feature for an incomplete allow-list (so use implicit allow-list mode): 5
          - to enable feature but implicitly allow-list for SYSTEM user to ease local development: 9
          - to disable feature completely if it had never been enabled: 16
          - to henceforth disable feature and try to undo its previous effects: 0
        Note: This list must be kept current with PACKAGE_WHITELIST_MODE_PROP in
        frameworks/base/services/core/java/com/android/server/pm/UserSystemPackageInstaller.java
        Package allow-list disabled for testing profile user as default allow-list does not
        support PROFILE user. -->
